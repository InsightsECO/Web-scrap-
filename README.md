# Project: Web Scraping for World Population Data Analysis

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of web scraping using Python's Beautiful Soup module to extract world population data from the Worldometer website. We aim to retrieve historical population data, perform data manipulation and cleaning using Python's Pandas library, and finally visualize the insights gained from the analysis.

## Conclusion:
Through this project, we successfully extracted historical world population data from the Worldometer website using web scraping techniques in Python. We then cleaned and manipulated the data to make it suitable for analysis. By visualizing the data, we gained insights into trends and patterns in global population growth over the years.

## Analysis:
- We started by fetching the website using the requests module and extracting HTML data.
- Utilized Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract relevant information, such as population data.
- Cleaned the extracted data using regular expressions to remove unwanted HTML tags and formatting.
- Employed Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, including splitting messy table data into a structured format.
- Visualized the cleaned data to analyze trends and patterns in world population growth.
- Finally, saved the processed data into an Excel file for further analysis or reporting.

## What We Did:
- Utilized Python's Beautiful Soup module to scrape data from the Worldometer website.
- Extracted historical world population data and performed data cleaning using Pandas.
- Visualized insights gained from the analysis to understand global population trends.
- Documented the process in a clear and concise manner for replication and further exploration.
